## Inventory Management API – Project Plan
Idea
The project is an Inventory Management API that allows a store to manage its stock items efficiently. The API will support basic CRUD operations for inventory items and users. It will also include endpoints for tracking inventory levels.

### Features
User Management


Register new users (store managers or staff).


Authenticate users (login/logout).


Role-based access (e.g., admin vs. staff).


Inventory Management


Add new items to inventory.


Update existing item details (e.g., quantity, price, description).


Delete items from inventory.


View all inventory items.


Inventory Levels


Check current stock levels.


Endpoint to get low-stock alerts (optional stretch goal).


### Deployment


API deployed on Heroku or PythonAnywhere for public access.



### API 
This project will not rely on an external API. Instead, it will be a custom-built RESTful API using Django REST Framework (DRF).

Models
User (Django’s built-in User or a custom one)


username


email


password


role (admin/staff)


InventoryItem


name


description


quantity


price


created_at


updated_at



### API Endpoints
Authentication


POST /api/auth/register/ – Create a new user.


POST /api/auth/login/ – Authenticate user.


POST /api/auth/logout/ – Logout user.


Inventory


GET /api/items/ – List all items.


POST /api/items/ – Add a new item.


GET /api/items/{id}/ – View single item details.


PUT /api/items/{id}/ – Update item details.


DELETE /api/items/{id}/ – Delete item.


GET /api/items/levels/ – View stock levels (optional).
